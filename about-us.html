        <p>
            Once upon a murky afternoon, our founder, Waachey, stood in a cafeteria filled with adolescents.
            The air smelled like dead sweat and dirty daipers. He vowed to rid the world of such horrible smell.
            And so, Waachey's House of PefPef was born -- a sactuary to those who want to smell exceptional and exquisite.

            classic floral or the intrigue of an exotic oud, we have a scent for every chapter of your life.
